# Hello World Emojis
Hello World Emojis is a Hello World Progressive Web App (HWPWA) that outputs all emoji characters, instead of the traditional "Hello, World!". You can easily scroll through the emoji list and spot new and interesting emojis that you can use. Or you can easily see how many emojis characters are missing on your platform.

## Development

Hello World Emojis is hosted on GitHub Pages, and served from the [/docs](docs) folder.

The emoji characters are retrieved from Unicode's [emoji-ordering.txt](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-ordering.txt) file, which contains "the Emoji v11.0 characters and sequences in the recommended sort order".

Prerequisites: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/). Editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
