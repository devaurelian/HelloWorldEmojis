# Hello World Emojis
Hello World Emojis is a Hello World Progressive Web App (HWPWA) that outputs all the emoji characters, instead of the traditional "Hello, World!". You can easily scroll through the list and spot new and interesting emojis that you can use. Or you can easily see how many emojis characters are missing on your platform.
